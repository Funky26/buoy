# SMART BUOY  
The Smart IoT Buoy is a compact and efficient water monitoring system designed for real-time environmental data collection. The project utilizes a microcontroller as the core processing unit, interfacing with multiple sensors to gather crucial water-related parameters.
## annotation  
The intelligent buoy is designed to provide reliable water environment monitoring with a focus on efficiency and environmental sustainability. The core of the buoy is the ESP32 microcontroller, which functions as the control unit. It manages sensor operations, processes data, and ensures wireless transmission via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The buoy is powered by a battery, which is recharged during the day by two photovoltaic panels.
